This batch file is made for the purpose of any file's manipulation according to our requirement.

I've compiled and made this from lot of google searches.
It's still in process as I've hardcoded my regular expressions in the file.
You can open and make changes according to your need in the functions Iâ€™ve made, or even make your own functions by replicating other functions.
